# Dynamic Beamforming Optimization for 5G Networks

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to optimize beamforming for 5G networks. The goal is to reduce signal interference and improve Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) by training a neural network on user and antenna positions.

## Features
- Simulates user and antenna positions in a 2D space.
- Calculates SNR for each user-antenna pair.
- Trains a neural network to optimize beamforming for improved SNR.
- Provides visualizations of SNR data and training progress.

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Main script for data preparation, model training, and prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `data/`: Sample data files for user and antenna positions.
- `models/`: Saved trained model.
- `plots/`: Visualizations generated during the project.
- `docs/`: Detailed project report in PDF format.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/beamforming-project.git
